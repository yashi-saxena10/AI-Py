Infact I am not sure whether i will get my refund or order. Never buying again anything from Nykaa.",NEGATIVE

I tried to contact customer care for morethan 4 days. Dey never attended the call. Always it says busy.. better they can delete the customer care number. The amount was not refunded at all. Useless app and i never recommend anyone. If u buy from this app it will be a headache. Pls dont use or buy from this..,NEGATIVE

"I have been a customomer for years now and shopped heavily during their hot pink sale. These kinds of sales are nothing new internationally and I appreciate Nykaa finally bringing offers to India. HOWEVER: -10 days and no sign of a Clinique gift set with purchase . On raising a concern, I have been offered a 300 rupee voucher! Value of gift set is 2800. Is this a joke? - Most promotional products delivered expiring in 5-6 months Companies still treat Indian customers like second grade citizens",NEGATIVE

U place an order with 2 items. Nykaa provide you with an estimated date of delivery. Till the last date of the estimation as provided no communication from Nykka side. After I call I am informed one of the two products I ordered is out of stock. And the other time will delievrd to me ASAP. Now my question is if Nykaa knew that one item is not available why did they wait for me to call and then initiate the refund process? So does Nykaa wait for the consumer to follow up for the delivery timeline of the product?Does Nykaa own any responsibility of doing their business?,NEGATIVE

track the order it says it's dispatched on 01/05/18 and that's it. I tried 
contacting Nykaa about this through Facebook and the app's customer care

resolved. I am extremely dissatisfied with this app. This is going to be 
the 1st and last time I use your app.",NEGATIVE

Bad experience. The delivery dates on the site/app do not match with the actual delivery dates which is highly misleading for a customer. It's a difference of 4-5 days! Also customer care says products can be delivered on urgent basis but that's not mentioned in the app or site anywhere. Is it expected that the customer call up customer care everytime while placing order? I placed order as the delivery dayee were 12th but get a message on 12th that order is dispatched from Mumbai on 12th. I called up the customer care and they said it will take another 3-4 working days! They cant cancel as it's already dispatched and it will be cancel once returned. The pace of delivery has me thinking how long it takes to get the refund and if at all! Hugely disappointed.,NEGATIVE

i had an overall good experience with nykaa but this one particular incident has left me in doubts. I had ordered an undereye gel and had been using it for quite some time. Only very recently i started having slight itching around my eyes and one morning i woke up to swollen eyes and red allergy around my eyes. When i checked the eye cream turns out it had already expired on 3/18. I had bought it on 10/18. I trusted blindly at nykaa. I am shocked and mighty upset at nykaa.,NEGATIVE

"I overall like the app. It has good products all in one place and it's easy to shop for products by trying them on your skin tone. But the problem? They don't have a skin tone trial for dark skin tone. It kinda sucks that in a country where majority of the people are brown, you don't have a trial tone available for them. Why!? Are we not entitled to look beautiful or buy beauty products like lipsticks and nailpaints? For a modern day beauty app, that's so very cheap of you!",NEUTRAL
When offers are running though the price of the products are less they deliver these less priced product  which dates near to the expiry . They deliver expiry product and not fresh products.,NEGATIVE

The first time i ordered products from Nykaa they were of amazing quality so i happily placed an order for the 2nd time but i was very disappointed to see that sadly products quality wasn't the same. I've been using Mac and other brands for a long time so i could tell the products weren't the original manufacturings. Infact I had to stop using Mac kajal and Maybelline makeup remover completely (ordered from Nykaa) as it was affecting my skin and eyes. P.S- I'll have to think order anything again.,NEGATIVE

However, recently the app performance has become very sluggish and hangs A LOT especially during sales. So if they have a flash sale from 6-9, you'll spend 2 hours trying to get the app to work and will probably miss the sale. It would also be great if they could be more flexible with returns. Otherwise a great place to shop.",NEUTRAL

"Hi Nykaa team,  Though this company is a life saver as we have got a dedicated cosmetics application. But the problem is I find it easier to search products on the app as compared to portal. Just moving my cursor across makes things appear on my screen (I m using Safari browser on Mac) and it is difficult to resign them. It is really annoying. I would request you to kindly make it user friendly. Things keep on appearing, disappearing, loading and stuff. The mobile app is better in the sense of UI but still lags when I have to filter products or so. Kindly look into it.",NEUTRAL

"You guys need to SERIOUSLY work on your delivery. Sometimes it comes without prior notice and no one is home. We have to run around trying to track the order later because of that. And the other times, there is prior notice... Only for the order to not turn up. Everyone in my house is either working or busy, it is not possible to always wait around for a delivery for it to not show up. You guys need a better system. Either give us an option to give specific delivery orders. Or give us a more accurate tracking. It seriously is so not convenient.",NEUTRAL

Tho most worth less service I have ever seen. First of all they will not deliver your item saying that consignee was not available at home then when you call the customer support team they will only say we have raised your concern and the team will take care of it and you will get your item as soon as possible. After that they will resolved the ticket without helping you. Even the third party courier will not answer your phone call. Just worthless so will suggest to you think twice before invest your money in nykaa.,NEGATIVE
So good l love you Nykaa😍😍,POSITIVE

Worst experience at nykaa . They claim to have easy refund policy but that's all fake. I got a defective product (eyepencil) from nykaa(doesn't work properly) worth rs 499 which they refused to refund. Talked to customer agent many times told my issues. Send all the images. Still no response. Wasted my pocket Money. Fraud. Buy at your own risk because if something goes wrong they are not answerable. Edit: this is fake concern please reply to mail l have already sent on support@nykaa,NEGATIVE

Have been using this app for a while... one day they suddenly asked me to login again and didn't accept my ID.... I had to create a new acct.....

"Not a very good 1st impression.... I used this on recommendation and I feel I was misled. To begin, the app does not clearly state timescales. It works superfast while placing an order and collecting a payment and gets all your hopes up high, but after that YOU ARE ON YOUR OWN !!!! I placed my order on Monday (3.8.20) and had no update until even now. The app keeps saying "" Waiting for branch to dispatch "". The app now states that it takes 48-72 hours to dispatch....",NEGATIVE

Very bad support service.. I'd purchased first time from nykaa And received a wrong product . For that I've submitted product replacement request on same day on its support and grivance mail id. Also trying to connect with support agent through chat.and it has been 3 days now Still did not get any response. I did not expect this from nykaa. Very disappoint with customer service.,NEGATIVE
Horrible experinece. Do not trust this app or website. They mention as returnable product but they will not provide a button to return a product once purchased. Another tactic of nykaa to con a customer. Even after u talk to customer care they will keep delaying the number of days so that the returnable period expires. Better but from Amazon with better customer service n transparent policy.,NEGATIVE

No doubt it is the best online portal for skin care. But I m disappointed by their return and replacement policy. They will take so many days whatever they want to .There is no any fixed dateline for solving such problems. It really sucks. I dont understand they are doing fast delivery but when it comes to pick up damaged product fot return and replacement no fixed dateline. I still have damaged product waiting for pick up.God knows when will they cm....,NEUTRAL

"Honestly the delivery, products, all are great. But what use is an app if u can't find what u're looking for? The algorithm on this app just plain sucks, so much that I couldn't help but review about it. It turns out the algorithm doesn't know how to pick the simplest of keywords to provide you with an appropriate search result. But if you google the product it will show up. Now how do you expect your customers to buy what they need if your inbuilt search box won't do the job. Plz fix it.",NEGATIVE

No doubt. Nykaa is the best beauty shopping platform and my favourite among all. But this app is not working in my oneplus 6T. Whenever I try to open the app it keeps on loading. Therefore I use nykaa lite app to order my stuff from nykaa. I wish this issue gets resolves quickly so that i can smoothly use the main nykaa app. I gave one star only bcoz of this reason bcoz it doesn't work in my phone. Other than that it deserves 5 star.,NEGATIVE

"My first review ever after being so pissed by ""the great Nykaa"" support. I actually wanted to give a zero. It's a horrible horrible experience to buy anything from this website/app, as though you are stealing something and they won't let you. It's even more horrible to cancel something as though you are again trying to steal your own money. This website and it's support, sucks. Please Nykaa, work on your website and support before your inventory. Value your customer's TIME & MONEY.",NEGATIVE
"I ordered lip crayons and received used and damaged products.  Furthermore when I am trying to get it replaced via application,  the service again and again is not available. Fully unsatisfied with the service...  Sir the damage was not damage on transit which you cannot control.... The crayons were used products which definitely is a poor service from your side... Till date I have not received any of the returns and refund for the same. I would never suggest anyone to order from this....",NEGATIVE

"As long as you do not require to return any product this app is nice. The moment you initiate any return you will come across the reality. I have been using this since around two years and never experienced any issues as I never needed to return any product. Recently I refused the delivery of two products (there was no cancellation option after the shipping) and the products were returned and reached their destination. I have reported this issue at least 8 times and havnt received any refund yet. However, their executives told me that the refund has been initiated. It has een 8 days and I know well it does not take such long for the refunds to be processed. Secondly, I had to return four products and since i was going out of town I handed over those products to the security persons of the colony. The pick up guy took two of the products and the refund initiated was for another two products. I have reported this issue a million times and everytime i am asked to wait for 24 hrs or 48 hrs and this time never ends. Another of my return request was rejected and they didnt even bother to give the reason for rejection. When i contacted they told me that the image was not clear but trust me the image was crystal clear, however, i once again uploaded the required images and i was assured that the return has been initiated. It has been endless time and the request has still not been approved. I am really really pissed off with their services. Pathetic experience. Never gonna use this app again. I have already placed emails in the past and havnt received any response yet.",NEGATIVE

"Once upon a time I rated this app with 5 stars are I am using this aap from long time and I used to love this aap. Recently I ordered many products and in that one nykaa mini lipstick was there which seems to be used product. I placed that for replacement and my request rejected, now I can't even use that product as it seems to be used and my final option is to throw away (waste of money ). I never gonna use this aap again , highly disappointed as I was regular customer.",NEGATIVE

I haven't received the product but it already shows on MY ORDERS list it has been delivered. There is no option to raise my concern. How does this delivery works? I have no idea. Can't they have a confirmation call or message with the customer to ensure.,NEGATIVE

The best online cosmetics store I have ever come through. The Nykaa products are actually GOOD.,POSITIVE
I placed my first and definitely the last order on 17th Oct. The products were not dispatched for 4 days so I sent an email. An auto reply stated a response in 24 hrs. But no luck.  A similar email was sent again. But there was no reply either. Finally I sent a feedback and then finally got a response that there is some rare delay. And they will try their best to dispatch products in next 3-4 days. I finally got my product just now after 10 days.  Avoid for you own piece of mind.,NEGATIVE
"There is no fixed or approximate date of delivery and the contact details 
of courier person which makes it a little inconvenient to shop, also I 
referred a friend and didn't got any credits as promised, apart from that

Had a bitter experience of shopping at Nykaa.Really the worst make up shopping app!!Had ordered a PAC eyebrow shaper in brown shade which appeared quite dark brown on the app but after it got delivered I swatched it on my hand and saw that it was very light and did not match my brow colour.After requesting for a replacement (not a refund)I got a reply stating that I cannot replace used product.I even sent them the image to prove that I have not used the product at all but still they told they cannot do it.It was a pathetic experience for me really! Customers mean nothing to them!Other apps are much better in giving customer service and also have a hassle free refund or replacement policy.,NEGATIVE

Very bad customer service. They only deliver the product but if you face any issue they will not look into it. They just neglect their customer. You can only buy from here but don't ecpect any customer priority or help. They will just ignore it. It's thrice I have faces problem here and they just ignored it. Not going to use this app any more and will advice my reader to do thw same beacuse if you receive a damage product or its not what it claim to be you can't seek help. Use alternative app.,NEGATIVE

Good,NEUTRAL
The app works fine service doesn't. Don't ever ever buy any electronic items from this app. If you get a broken or a product that doesn't work they will not assist in anyway. Nor does the brand help you. Your money will be wasted if you get a broken product. And the most important point if you decide to write a negative review on their site for that product your review will not be posted ever it's been two months since I wrote the original review if not more however my review is not there.,NEGATIVE

The delivery guy made me roam around my delivery address for more than an address changing the delivery point time to time. When I finally reached there, he left and was not picking up the call. Also a request to Nykaa to send the whole order in a single parcel, not in installments. It becomes really difficult to go each day to the delivery point to pick up the parcel.",NEGATIVE

Products sold are genuine. No duplicate products. The only problem which i faced in my one order was they showed free Nykaa matte lipstick 399rs on purchase of 1200rs but after placing the order after 2 hours they said your free gift is cancelled. So was little disappointed buy such behavior. But later when i complained about it they first where ready to give 100Rs coupon and when i said i want 399rs only they got ready for 300Rs coupon.,NEUTRAL

The product collection is good. But beware.. If your transaction fails.. Count your money lost. I lost 2000 Rs after a failed transaction and never got it back. Nykaa ppl just kept saying they never got the money. But i checked both through my bank and payu. Both said the transaction went through and provided the proof which i sent to nykaa.. But did not get any response. Now i am scared of buying anything from here lest I lose more money.,NEGATIVE

"Dear nykaa team, It will be very kind of you, if you suggest ur media developer unit to control the frequency of popping up n showing ad uselessly more than once because it obstructs my phone work.

Found a used product. I sent visually clear images that the product is used. But they do not want to approve the return. The product was tampered and was used by someone else during this Covid 19 pandemic. Their quality is not good and customer support sucks big time. Do not order from their website as they do not take due diligence in the shipment. Be safe avoid Nykaa.,NEGATIVE

"This app doesn't deserve single star also. their service and their logistics partners are so pathetic, horrible and jobless. I think this app Nykaa and their so called team is sitting somewhere to ensure the product never get delivered to anyone who orders through this useless app. secondly customer care executive doesn't know how to respond with customer. most worst part is, they itself couldn't track the order even after the ETA is crossed. i won't insist or recommend this app to anyone.",NEGATIVE

Customer care & App are not good! I had made an order during the pink Friday sale but the delivery address got selected to the wrong address & I tried to ask the help center to cancel the order but they said since it's shipped it will reach the address and multiple attempts are also made even after informing the problem. Instead if they could cancel the order I could try making a new order within the sale period. Also my birthday gift was in this order but it may not be re-added to my new oder.,NEGATIVE

"Very glitchy app.  I am surprised with the 4 star reviews here as they have not gotten same basics right! 1)For one, if you want to go back to the home page,clicking on the Nykaa icon doesn't get you there (as it would happen with any app) and you have to keep pressing the back button to get to the home page. God bless your patience if you have surfed multiple pages!! 2) My latest order isn't showing, although the amount has been debited from my account. 3) When I tried to email them through the app (I am signed in to the app), I have to fill in my name, email address all over again. What for? I am already signed in and it should be pre-fed with the option to change if needed. 4) On clicking the 'submit' button, it says 'error, try again'.   If you guys are listening, please fix these things. I am sure many have the time and patience to put up with these silly mistakes. But many also don't. Also, it would really help everyone if you guys use the app to do some shopping yourself.",NEGATIVE

Same day I received product I requested for return mail them all the details with bill, box, and product which I have not used at all. Nykaa firstly denied to return later on they forwarded me bronson contact no and mail id. Bronson not even received my calls they replied ro my mail saying we are service centre we can repair the product we cannot return or exchange kindly contact nykaa team. Then I get back to nykaa with all this conversation with bronson brand they said we can't return and refund only thing we can do is exchange the same product I said no now I don't believe this product plzz provide me cash voucher so that I can buy anything else in future but nykaa denied to this service also. Now my money is waste and product I received is good for nothing. Thanku nykaa for helping your clients soo well i delete your app from my mobile and will never use your app. Other apps are far more better in these situation. Last and good thing to share that nykaa people are not ready to accept that the product I received is very low quality cheap product road side product",NEGATIVE

I had the worst customer service experience in one of the nykaa store which is in Subash Nagar. Your staff is either busy checking out chicks/guys or judging them or gossiping among themselves rather than helping a customer. I literally had to stand for 15 minutes and then I gave up. also when i asked for a particular shade staff said there is no such shade however the same shade does exist so they probably aren't aware of their own products. what an eye opener guys 👏👏👏,NEGATIVE

Worst Wow thanks to nykaa. They just deleted my review as they don't want the users to read it but I'll write it again and again. Don't order anything from nykaa as they'll promise you to provide options before you order but will give you nothing and if you'll come up with the complaint then they will give you a small refund and say sorry to you. Feelings don't matter to them only business matters to them so they just will refund for their mistake and don't think about customer who order as gift,NEGATIVE

It's very horrible. They thinks they are right but in reality they are not. I will strictly  not recommend to anyone. Buy the same product from other sites or local retailer.

Hoping to file a case in consumer forum.,NEGATIVE

"I had placed an order with nykaa on the 9th of November. On the 12th I got the update that my products are out for delivery and should reach me the same evening however that did not happen. The status on the app said delivery failed as the delivery guy wasn't able to reach my no. Whereas I did not even get a call. And if that wasn't enough, on the 13th I spoke to 4 different customer service representatives, one of which hung up on me, the other just vanished half way through the call, the third told me that he'll put up a request and that my products should reach me in the next 24 - 48 hours, though I did not get a confirmation for the same. The fourth was a call I got from nykaa customer service and the representative again promised that the product will reach me the next day and when I told her that I'd already spoken to someone from their department about the same, she had no idea about it so probably the third representative also failed to do what he promised. It's the 14th now and my products still haven't been delivered. Nykaa customer service is the worst, will never ever order from it again. It's the 17th and I still haven't received my order. I have honestly never had such a bad experience with online shopping before.",NEGATIVE

Never purchase from Nykaa India anything because you never get it. Worst customer support. Worst courier partner (wow express).👿😡 This is second time when the courier status showing the fake remark..consignee refused...If there is zero star I gave it to your courier partner (wow express).

"Nykaa has the worst customer support, I wanted to talk to them regarding a scam over my account.i tried reaching them 3-4 times, they put me on hold saying we are connecting you to scam agent....n then the call go on wait until it gets disconnected automatically.. means u do not bother your customer concerns even when they are highly important",NEGATIVE
Worst service ever....i have been tracking my package with these guys since 18th of September.....it was to be delivered by then however had failed....as per tracking details the product was in Gurgaon....the customer care called me back on 19th to inform i will receive the product within next 24 hrs....post which i waited 48 hrs and contacted Nykaa yesterday and a floor supervisor Sushant promised me that i will receive the package either by eod yesterday or latest today in the first half....cut to today i waited and as expected the order did not get delivered so i called Nykaa back....after almost an hour of war of words i was transfered to Ritu the supervisor of Sushant who said she cannot get the package delivered before Monday....post getting off the call with Nykaa i called aramex to check if i can self collect the product from kolkata hub (rajarhat chinnar park branch ) of aramex....i was informed by aramex that they took my request up this morning when i called (which i didn't but i guess Nykaa did)....so i spoke to this supervisor from Aramex and was surprised to know that the first ever escalation that was made on my tracking number  (package) was today itself on the call made to aramex by Nykaa prior to i did.....so all this time since 18th till yesterday the entire team of Nykaa Customer service (siddhart praveen sushant ritu) has been lying to me about the alleged continuous follow up they have been making....whom do i reach out to now.....? Consumer forum or should i send a legal notice to Nykaa for not just harassing me but also lying to me blatantly.....? Wish i had called Aramex in the first instant Nykaa told me that they are contacting the logistics....atleast i would have been saved from this excruciatingly pathetic harrassment.... PS : I have the calls with Nykaa and Aramex both recorded at my end.....wondering what should i do .... Latest update from Nykaa that too after i called (wherein they assured that i will not have to).....initially upon calling they said it will take another 24 to 48 hours (like i have not waited enough).....when i refused to accept the wait time and informed will report to the Consumer Forum they tell me that they have received and email two hours back from their logistics team that the package containing my order is lost 😫😫😫😫😫😫😫 And it took them 7 days since i first contacted them on 18th to find out that my package was lost and it took them an ultimatum from me (informing them about reporting this to the consumer forum)to let me know that the package was lost otherwise on the same call they said 5 min back that I'd receive the product within the next 24 or 48 hours....this is sick....guys please do not order from NYKAA....bunch of liars with the least regard for customers....and im going to take an action now ....i have all the proofs of  your lies and dishonesty NYKAA,NEGATIVE

I was very happy with Nykaa but their delivery service is getting worst and worst. I received  part of my order and don't know what happened with other part. One order was never delivered. Sad is the site doesn't show any estimated delivery day! They will come anyway at your door without any prior information and if you're not home they will not send it again. Agents will call you and say that it will be rescheduled but it never does! If you call the customer service they will ask you to place an fresh order. What's the point of 'sale' then? If I have to place a fresh order with higher price?! I don't think I will order from Nyssa ever again. Don't know what will happen with the other orders I placed recently!,NEGATIVE
Lovely 😍😍,POSITIVE

"Every time make payment through UPI app the money is debited but the app shows an error message right after that. The order is not confirmed but the money is still debited, items still in cart, and me still stressed. It has happened quite often like 6 times. And every time I was told it will be fixed. But with no updates.",NEGATIVE
The worst app . I had placed an order long bavk but havent received it yet . When i called customer care they say its out of stock but it was available on the app. They dont have the basic sense of responsiblity towards informin me that they cant deliver the order . Dont order anything from Nykaa as it will never reach you and you even get to know if you yourself dont call them and ask for an update . Worst app ever used,NEGATIVE

I ordered around 7 products from here and requested for a return of 2 of my products as i got them wrong and they didn't even respond. It's been 5 days now and there is no response. I am just sitting here stuck with the wrong products. Doesn't matter if Nykaa provides unique product line of their own, it's not worth it if they won't be answerable to you after you buy from them. It's stupid!",NEGATIVE

"Just uninstall this app. Don't buy from nykaa ever! I have been using this app for 3 years. This is a money hungry company shamelessly promoted by so called, ""influencers"" Better to use sephora instead. You will only see brand names but you will be disappointed with shade ranges and price. Bad offers and way more expensive than actual price ps they charge a lot for delivery. Sometimes they give out unsealed/close to expiration products. Worst costumer care, they don't even respond to your mail!",NEGATIVE

Its 15th of august today and my seller has not even confirmed the order.On the top of that when i thought to cancel the product from my cart and order it from somewhere else i got a notification saying that if i cancel the order i will lose my 400rs coupon.I emailed the grievances officer and got a revert from the team that delievery may take longer than usual with no updation in the order. This is how they treat their customers.Very poor service..,NEGATIVE

"Avoid going for prepaid option. They send the items through courier services & there is no support in case your item is lost or undelivered. My order is sent through WowExpress. The delivery guy did not contact me. I simply got a message that item could not be delivered. On 2nd day, the status was 'Out for delivery' but nothing happened. I directly contacted WowExpress but they refused to share delivery agent's contact number. No support on Nykaa app. Only useless rescheduling option.",NEGATIVE

"Cheating customers!! Ordered a product for the first time and received a fake empty bottle of some haldi chandan facewash( i ordered a moisturizer).

Never buying anything from here total wastage of money and time.",NEGATIVE

Lately my experience with nykaa has changed. No customer care service. Cannot cancel order or particular product.

They say easy return policy. But its way too difficult to return a thing. And the customer care is taking lot of time to respond and he ended the conversation before i finished my queries.I had to return 2 lipsticks and one deo. Saying that its used and not a tester they cancelled the return request. But i didnt use it. I jus tried on my hand. Or else how ill i understand the shade? And they r telling me its not a tester. So will they give one?? They didnt reply about the deo. And ended conv,NEGATIVE

"Your website is the shittiest in terms of the user interface. it hangs. the page expires. and never able to reach and browse smoothly. i know the reason behind such interface is the people download the app and it is morally unethical in terms of your organisation. nykaa used to give amazing offers earlier, but after gaining the brand loyalty, not many great offers are available. a lipstick of ₹650 costs ₹650 in nykaa but ₹487 on Amazon (which also has the brand as the seller). it's unfair!",NEGATIVE

really really pathetic service from Nykaa. i ordered something from there and it was not delivered. I have to chase them and the product is still not delivered. I have raised the issue with them 5 times and they are not taking the matter seriously. All they say is we have esclated the matter. Above all the deliver team of Nykaa lies that they couldn't contact us. Would advice Nykaa to change there Delivery service. Otherwise they would end up having 1000's of unstatisfied customers,NEGATIVE

Best app for all types of cosmetic brands and you get all genuine products .. they also get many offers and their delivery charges are also reasonable to go .

substantial action. Only god can bless you and your business. When will you

"Im giving 1 rating to nykaa for not delivering my prepaid order. Reason 
they quoted product is out of stock. If this is the scenario then they 
should keep their app updated. Now instead of refunding my money in the a/c 
they are refunding it to nykaa wallet which means i can use that money to 
buy another nykaa products only. I must say very cunning tactic. Stop 
fooling customers. There was another incidence where nykaa updated me that 
they have delivered my prepaid order, i had to call them many times to 
confirm that I haven't received my package yet.",NEGATIVE

It's very disappointing Nykaa . I have placed one order of Huda beauty lipsticks trendsetter and Strobe set about 20 days ago but it's still not delivered to me. I placed the order twice too thinking this time it will be delivered to me but sadly this time also happened the same thing. I was kept waiting . It was a pathetic experience with Nykaa and I am never going to buy any of your products. And for your kind information I also raised concern about my order and rescheduled the delivery date but it was of no help.,NEGATIVE

"No complaints regarding products but Delivery is PATHETIC. They dont deliver on Saturday Sunday and Weekdays they dont deliver and put false remarks like ""Door closed, no response"".

Since 1and a half month this app is temporarily disabled in my state. I contacted them through emails they say there delivery partners have not resumed the service but all other apps have been delivering the products . Even when your delivery partner was working my products were not delivered until I complained to your representative at least twice to three times..so I think it's high time you change your delivery partner.,NEGATIVE

"Worst app. Bcz it doesn't apply the offers mentioned in the app itself n when u ask customer care about what had happened to the offer, he tells you that the stock must have been over by then n that is the reason it was not applied. Then y do u even give false offers n cheat the customers?? Another thing is it doesn't let you return the products which u do not like and return gets rejected. Bcz u have ordered,it's not a compulsion u shud like all the products as they may not be as in the image.",NEGATIVE

"Hi, I know very well that Nykaa is primarily a store for cosmetics and makeup essentials, however, if they display hair styling appliances in their list of products, they must have them in stock too! I have been waiting to buy a Corioliss and a Gorgio hair curler for the past one and a half month and it has never been in stock since then. If you do not keep a product then why show it in the first place?! I must say this is a very poor policy, and it needs to be restructured asap.",NEUTRAL

Order delivery had improved but Cancellation and refund its a tedious process. If u call to cancel a product they say that we have to reject the order during delivery that is waist of time. So have to wait till the unaccepted products reach their warehouse then 48 hrs to process the refund then 5 days for it to come to a/c so total 7days for refund of amount. N the refund amount cannot be added in nykaa wallet.,NEUTRAL

"Nykaa is probably the worst marketplace for purchasing fashion and beauty related cosmetic products. A large number of products are listed on this platform in the name of most popular brands, however, after you purchase those products you must be able to realise that those are totally fake and confiscated.

Whether on chat app, emails or even calls.... The service is extremely poor and disappointing. Either have the patience to follow up n number of times or just forget about the product all together.

It is a good app to get genuine products but the only con here is their customer service is really poor. They don't respond once you have some problems after receiving your product. Like in my case I ordered a pair of eyelashes along with many other things but the eyelash glue that is complimentary with it was all dried up. I tried reaching customer services even emailed them but thay just turned deaf ears to my problems.,NEUTRAL

"After tall promises of prompt deliver, delivery date supassed & post-poned by 2 days. Had I known this was the case I would have just bought the same products on a different platform. My first order with Nykaa & a disappointing one. Remains to be seen, how the product itself is now. Expectations let down bigtime! Yet again order has been delayed by a week.

Nykaa in long run you are going to lose cause Amazon & Flipkart is giving way cheaper deals on cosmetic than you. For example 'Neutrogena oil free moisture' on app is of Rs.338 but at Amazon Rs.243(subscribe it then Rs.230) & at Flipkart-243. And that's just one 1 product. So were do you think I will buy product. Give cheaper deals or else you will lose. Also there was no way of giving you feedback or suggestion on your app so I had to come here i.e. on play store. Seriously man what are you doing.,NEUTRAL

"The app is quite good. The comments left by other customers are pretty useful before buying the product. The page where you can try the lipstick by picking up your skin shade is also helpful. The issue I had faced is regarding the gift cards. Someone gifted my gift cards of smaller value. The app doesn't let you enter multiple cards, you can only apply one gift card value at a time because of this I have to place multiple orders of smaller value which was quite a task. Please allow your app to accept multiple gift cards in one go.",NEUTRAL

Don't buy anything from nyka. They gonna send you damaged products and their customer service is poorest of all. They're having poor service in all categories whether it's about the product shown in pictures or the customer service- they aren't going to reply you ever no matter how much you try..I had tried through every possible mean but they just don't care and last but not the least they will take so much time to deliver that you'll forget even about your order. Please never ever buy anything from this place.,NEGATIVE
"Do not order from them, prepaid order and not getting delivered because ""due to the lockdown"" and its been over a month since I place my order After multiple follow up regarding my product its still not getting delivered. Didn't expect such poor services from nykaa and more over Customer service executive don't even connect to feedback call just because they think they will get poor ratings.",NEGATIVE

Please don't install this app & waste your data and time.

Chat services of this app is also useless. Because they are not able to resolve your issues efficiently. They just ask you to update your address again and again. And the courier services of this app is also very poor and arrogant.,NEGATIVE

i have been a proud nykaa customer till date.have been buying there products for last one year again n again.i ordered one Maybelline lipstick of 450/- which was actually labeled as 299/-only.also i ordered one nykaa nailpolish in nutcracker dream but got different shade.but the labelled slip is showing same name.under sale they have been selling the products bu crossing all the ethics.when i complained on customer care they told e they cant return as the product is used now.i was like ok but atleast once they were supposed to admit their mistake.the executive kept telling me that br cautious while online shopping.this is ridiculous.selling unethically under the name of 'sale' n then not admitting the mistake.didnt expect this from a growing brand like nykaa.disappointed,NEGATIVE

When I opened the app I found it to be good but when ordered and got delivery of the product it was just the opposite from the image shown. I couldn't return the product also because I swatched a bit on my hand as they told I wouldn't get my product back after quality testing if it is used so along with the product the money is gone .1st of all its their mistake that they are not providing fruitful images .2nd they are not taking the product back if u r just swatching a bit .!!wrost app.!!💩,NEGATIVE

"A very good and useful app for online shopers. Love it. But it can be better. For example, they can keep their own delivery guys rather than using third-party couriers. Those courier guys are not always friendly and once a courier guy didn't even deliver the product and returned it just because I was 5 minutes late on receiving his call. If that can be taken care of then I'll give 5 Stars.",NEUTRAL

kindly dont install and use this app. it's a waste of money and time ordering from here. visiting a conventional store or even ordering from Amazon is better. I ordered merchandise from here for the first time and received near to expiry date products. it was a tough task initiating for return pick up and then requesting for refund. there is no customer service associate to speak with whom you can explain your issues. unable to request for return pickup. worst app,NEGATIVE

"Nykaa had been one of the greatest apps till the last update, now the app has become too slow and i cannot open my cart, it's not loading at all. Pls fix this asap. Another bad thing that happened is that in these hard times during covid19, they have raised their minimum cart value to 1000 and shipping charges to 99 (which was earlier 500 and 49 respectively). You guys should understand that people always don't need products worth such a big amount, and you can't punish your customers for that.",NEGATIVE

"Experience of First purchase at Nykaa was very bad. Ordered a nose trimmer. 
After delivery, when i checked the item, i found it useless as it was not 
working properly. When i called Nykaa care, its representative denied to 
exchange or refund the item despite half hour discussion also she didn't 
provided any alternative for the same at Nykaa side. Now Nykaa has advised 
me to contact the brand but they are still not providing a refund or 
replacement for the product that is not working properly from very first 
day after receiving the product from nykaa. I am still unaware about the 
policy of Nykaa who are selling defective electronics products with no 
refund or replacement by Nykaa. Nykaa is only fooling its customers. Very 
bad policy and will never purchase again at NYKAA",NEGATIVE

"The products sold are 100% legit. I blindly trust this app. The legitimacy is the reason why they don't have a huge discounts like amazon/ flipkart. They do have sales occasionally where they sale products reaching their expiration but again, not fake. The app is pretty easy to use, it's standard with accurate search results and reviews. Their reviews are verified too.",POSITIVE

I see it as an annoyance and it's giving me more motivation everyday to uninstall.",NEUTRAL

Very bad experience in the recent days. They kept the order to be confirmed for two days. After the order was shipped it was delivered to the destination yesterday at 7am still they did not attempt for delivery. And even I am not sure if they will deliver it today also. They are just making an excuse of pandemic.. nykaa wake up.. everything is open now and supply chain is normal so stop fooling the customers repeating the same thing on one mode. Highly disappointed.,NEGATIVE

I had a very bad experience with Nykaa I trusted this brand blindly just to get decieved. Return policy is just horrible. Almost four days they have shipped a broken duplicate hair brush straightner and not intiated the refund. Now this is pathetic.,NEGATIVE
awesome,POSITIVE
Worst store ever. Usually customers face issues while ordering products online but at nykaa the story is different. The staff is intolerable especially the chanakya ones. The staff is so rude you can't even imagine. Firstly they'll try to fool you by giving the wrong shade of the product or they just try to give the least selling item. I bought a foundation which I applied there but they gave me a 50% darker shade. So I wasn't asking for any refund and just asked for a new shade of the foundatio,NEGATIVE

Have ordered 800 rs jewelry set. It was worse than 50 RS product. Have raised replacement/refund request as soon as I got the product. But they simply denied it by saying it's not refundable and apparently it's my mistake that I haven't seen it while ordering. It's a great way to do fraud. Well done Nykaa and team. Will never order something ever in life & will keep spreading this message. Please don't delete my review or ask me to contact me to customer support as it's useless.,NEGATIVE

"Nykaa I am giving you 1 star just because I can't rate you below that. It's pain to deal with you people if there is complaint w.r.t product we ordered. I think you don't check our complaints/ replacement request. And if get in touch with your customer care, then we have to go through entire process again and this time it will be even more time consuming. If you don't support a proper return policy, then atleast make it clear, don't waste our time. Pathetic",NEGATIVE

"The customer support is worst. The toll free number is not supported to call. They don't even chat at the help desk. The date of delivery suddenly changes within hours from 10 days to next day and if you're out of station on that day and request to deliver it a day after, they just cancel it. They don't even call you before cancelling. You can't call the deliveryman or the delivery company in any way.",NEGATIVE

It was always a great experience with nykaa. love shopping love nykaa,POSITIVE
"The products in the app are not updated hence, if you place an order for a product, you would have to wait endless days and weeks. If you contact support through chat, the Chat Bot is clueless of what to update hence, you end up chatting with someone. Nykaa doesn't have the products and have the courage to send spam emails everyday. Just like other eCommerce sites, what's stopping you from updating your infrastructure? It's high time, Nykaa stops hiding behind the pandemic situation.",NEGATIVE

"This is really a pathetic app I have ever used to shop online. They guys don't keep their promise. At the time of order we recieve different delivery date, different date showing in orders options in app, different delivery date when we try to track the order. Also, customer care team says that date will be decided by logistic team. So that means we should not believe on any message or estimated delivery promise by nykaa guys. They don't care about their customers. Highly unsatisfactory response.",NEGATIVE

Very bad. I bought a nail polish. It was defective. The customer care said that they would refund my money and then when I asked for it the next day blatantly refused. The customer care was really dumb kept on asking the same question. She kept me stuck for hours on the chat and ultimately didn't reply. The indigenous nykaa products are really bad. I ordered a 300rs nail polish which was defected.,NEGATIVE

"Even though you have good products, where you guys actually need to pay more attention to is logistics. It is almost a week since the day my order was about to arrive.

I have loved products i purchased from your website and app, but the way you have made me wait faaaar beyond the promised delivery date ruined the experience.",NEGATIVE

Good,NEUTRAL
It's a good experience over nykaa as products are genuine but I would give suggestion that there should be an option for the reviews with images as well of the customers with their experience so that it would be easier for others to decide which would be best to buy. Most of the people don't buy lipstick nd other things from nykaa as they have confusion always & my experience was bad. Once I purchased MAC lipstick of more than 1000/-rs but the color was completely changed & it's useless.,NEUTRAL

I'm not talking about the prices after the discount. The original price of some products had 200 Rs to 350 Rs difference when I looked into the same product in other apps and website. In all other apps that I searched the original price was the same but only in Nykaa it was more. Frankly speaking, I don't trust this app anymore.",NEGATIVE

"Nykaa is really the only app where yu can purchase from so many international brands easily (and some great local brands).Thankyou for launching them, really.But you guys definitely need to improve the delivery protocol.When the product is out for delivery,yu should provide the contact details of the delivery agent, almost every other e-commerce app does that. So that the customer can co-ordinate the time of delivery and availability.Also a minor flaw, is return policy.You should consider this.",NEUTRAL

Installing and ordering from this app has been my worst experience of online shopping. They delivered a wrong product. It was non-returnable still I chose to write to them. Initially they took a long time to even respond to my texts and mails. When they did they were unwilling to give me the right product and wanted to refund instead. Fair enough! Then they even deducted the refund amount saying there was a discount when there clearly wasn't any. It's advisable to order from Amazon instead.,NEGATIVE

Worst ever service received.. They delivered a defective product worth of Rs. 2000 and when I have asked them to return or replace the product and in return they have given brands contact number (which is a wrong no.) and asked me to contact them and Nykaa just have washed out their hand from it. Advice others to avoid ordering from Nykaa as they are not listening to their customers even after their own fault and felt cheated...,NEGATIVE

"A big glitch in the review system is you can post all the reviews you want but the reviews get ""Approved"" by THEM (Nykaa), they can decide if your review vl get posted or not so obviously there is no 100% transparency with customers like other apps such as Amazon. Also they clearly mention that only write reviews about product and NOT abt service nd such reviews wont get approved. So, there is no way you can post a review about service or if your product was received damage due to poor delivery.",NEGATIVE

"Horrible Customer Service. I called the nyka call center and the call Representatives were horrendous. She would keep my phone on hold after I ask the question and wouldn't answer it. I had to repeat the same question again and again but she would just keep it on hold and with out resolving my issue she disconnected the Call. I called out customer service again and they again put my phone on hold and disappeared and never returned back, put on hold for 15 minutes. Eventually I had to disconnect.",NEGATIVE

Crashes everytime which hinders the process of transaction too. Lots of products are unavailable even in initial few minutes it showed to be available.

"Having such a functional market across india nykaa should atleast do 
something to improve their delivery service. We have lots of work all 
through out the day and some of us stay alone. Keeping that in mind the 
least nykaa could do is give the contact number of the person who is going 
to deliver so that we are aware of the time when the delivery person is 
supposed to come prior to the delivery. Since nykaa takes the support of 
third party to get items delivered they should improve it . Extremely 
disappointed with the delivery service of nykaa",NEUTRAL

"The customer service team does not exist. Chat bot and chat bot like csr says wait 72 hours. Emails get no response. Packaging has over the top excessive use of plastic.

No complaints. 9 out of 10 times, customer service team does well. This was an exception.",NEUTRAL

nyka is the best app for skin care products. all the products at about all the products that I bought were authentic. the price was quite high but then if we are getting the original products even at a higher price that's a good deal because when we go out and bargain for about 50 50 to 60 rupees on a single product we might not know if they are selling us copy product. n when there is the question of skin better pay more than buy fake. services are amazing e.g the fast delivery.,NEUTRAL

This one is the best beauty apps I have come across. Right from choosing your favorite products till its delivery everything is taken care very nicely. Once you place order you get text message as well as WhatsApp message on your registered mobile number and email id. You need not to go in app and track your delivery. They message you for every step till products are delivered safely. They launch impressive offers everytime I never ordered beauty product from any other app. Packaging is awesome.,POSITIVE

"All though, nykaa is the go to for all the high end rated cosmetics with fast delivery. Sometimes, during the sale, few items which has their expiry date nearby are sent as clearance of stock i believe. However, this is not right, being a popular cosmetic site in Indian I hope it maintains its brand value and avoids such practices.",NEUTRAL

Awesome app😍,POSITIVE
Worst online app. Custom support is a very poor. They don't even have a call support. My item was missing from the order they are just sending mails from multiple accounts which I believe are all fake. Guys don't shop online on Nykaa worst experience. Free shipping only above 1000k and the products are not upto the mark. They don't even show the bad reviews by customer. Check their twitter full of complaints!! Worst online experience,NEGATIVE
Worst app because I ordered body splash which was not good & I wanted to return. The only option was to chat and it was codi who was useless & asked me to wait for 24 hours but no one contacted me after that. I contacted 3-4 times & waited for 2 days with no help. Then i took the number from Google & called customer support who didn't help at all. He said we cannot return the item once its opened. Without using how can someone check the item. I never face any such issue from other apps.,NEGATIVE
Very good,POSITIVE

I have been using Nykaa since many years and also ordered products during lockdown . But since past 3 months the app is constantly telling me that my pincode isn't serviceable. I had enquired about it to the customer care too but they have no specific reason for it . They themselves are confused and not aware about it . This is very disappointing . No other shopping sites are being the way nykaa lately has been .Nykaa had been very cooperating and delivering ncly during lckdwn then why not now.,NEGATIVE

I bought two dress from Nykaa. When I bought both were in stock but they didn't confirm one of the purchase. I did inquiry they said product is out of stock once it will be in stock we will deliver.

I will not prefer Nykaa for anything. Usual order process is super slow. Customer support is worst.,NEGATIVE

Best app for cosmetics!!..thnqs nykaa 😘,POSITIVE
The app works fine and the prices are also good. One thing i didnt like about Nykaa is that its a big name and is still using plastic like anything. Product packed in plastic tubes or bottles are not controlled by nykaa but its packaging is. They use bubble wrap kinda thing inside the box which is sometimes not even needed. The box and the tap used also seems extra. They should learn from the brand ' Organic Riot' where they use recycled boxes which seems very enviroment friendly.,NEGATIVE
Loved it... Meets al my needs & d reviews too help me in choosing,POSITIVE

"Nykaa Beauty: Good experience,Nykaa Fashion:Horrible...1.Nykaadoes not take back returns inspite of a return policy. They do not abide by the return policies they have with each product. 2. No deliveries at all: I placed an order with nykaa on 23rd June 2020. It is still in SHIPPED status. I contacted the customer care thrice. They said they cannot cancel the item since it has been shipped. Then they said they will initiate the refund. But till today, no product, no refund, no reply from nykaa",NEGATIVE
